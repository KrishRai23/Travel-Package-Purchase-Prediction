# Travel-Package-Purchase-Prediction
The dataset contains detailed customer and interaction data aimed at understanding purchasing behavior for a newly introduced travel package. Customer details include demographic and lifestyle factors such as age, gender, occupation, marital status, and income, alongside variables like CityTier, which reflects the development level of the customerâ€™s city, and travel-specific preferences like preferred hotel property rating, number of trips, and number of persons or children planning to travel with them. Additionally, it captures ownership data such as whether the customer has a passport or owns a car. Interaction data focuses on the sales process, including the product pitched, pitch satisfaction score, duration of the sales pitch, and the number of follow-ups conducted.  

The primary objective of the project is to predict which customers are more likely to purchase the travel package based on these variables. This involves identifying the most significant features influencing purchasing behavior and determining patterns or customer segments that exhibit a higher likelihood of conversion. Insights derived from the analysis can help in optimizing marketing strategies, enabling targeted campaigns toward high-potential customer segments, and improving overall sales efficiency.
